# Hello Word(?)
Setting up this github thingy to start writing on the web. 
Why write now you say?
* **It’s about time.** I have always felt that I have nothing to say/to add to the conversation so never felt the need to write.
* **Reading** I have sort of fallen off the reading wagon since 2016. I can count on fingers the number of books I have read since. This has impacted my writing thought process since there is no fodder to feed on.
* **Weeknotes** I am going to start writing weeknotes to make some progress towards my writing goal. It’s going to be unstructured & not aimed at an audience so the pressure is off.
* **Accountabilty** Setting up this space & writing weeknotes would help me be accountable towards my goals, career etc & I can track my progress through these posts.
